List which files are staged, unstaged, and untracked
```
git status
```
Stage all changes in <directory> for the next commit
```
git add <directory>

Commit the staged snapshot, but instead of launching a text editor, use <message> as the commit message
```
git commit -m "<message>"
```
Create a new connection to a remote repo
```
git remote add <name> <url>
```
Push the branch to <remote>, along with necessary commits and objects
